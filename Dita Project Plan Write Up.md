## DITA Project Plan								Oct. 27 2020

**Explanation and Justification for the Proposed Link Structure**

Zotero is a free bibliography software that helps users to collect, organize, cite, and share information. However, Zotero’s website currently provides little information and guidance for its users. In order to solve this problem, our group is designing a user’s manual, in which users can access step-by-step instructions and resources to aid them throughout the process of using Zotero.

We will be writing our manual for graduate students using a read to learn to do approach by including tasks, concepts, references, and glossary terms. This ensures that the student can complete specific tasks that they might need if using Zotero for academic purposes, while also providing opportunities for continued, deeper learning if they so desire.<!-- Also, keep this audience in mind when you decide how to phrase the sections of this documentation. What do these tasks look like or sound like to your intended audience? Use terminology that they are going to recognize. -->

For example, students working on a collaborative annotated bibliography designed to serve as a resource for them to come back to during their studies could use this manual to quickly familiarize themselves with the important functions of Zotero. It would allow a more efficient workflow and easier collaboration through the built-in groups function. As a result, the work process would become more transparent, and Zotero’s main functions of organizing research would help these students build a cleaner, more effective bibliography.<!-- good sense of why this documentation is important -->

We will be organizing the topics based on user need, beginning with “Installing Zotero” and working toward more advanced functions, such as “Generating Bibliographies”. This structure will help users by scaffolding information from basic to complex as well as by providing them only with the necessary information, as they need it. <!-- okay ... also keep in mind the temporal order in which different tasks might occur. Are there some that belong earlier than others? -->

*Zotero Functions as Main Topics*

We will organize the manual by function and provide a comprehensive explanation of the associated tasks, concepts, terms, and references. Each of the X main topics will address a function, such as “Getting Stuff Into Your Library” and “Organizing Your Library and Taking Notes”. Action-oriented main topics communicate to the reader in terms they are familiar with and appeal to their needs at any given moment when using Zotero. In turn, this will allow users to find what they are looking for faster and more accurately. <!-- agreed. -->

*Zotero Subtopics as Concept Topics*

Under each main topic, there are many subtopics, which we will write as concept topics. Doing this will align the user’s experience with the function with the very tool necessary to complete the function. For example, if a user wants to add an item to their library, they will navigate to the main topic, “Adding Items to Zotero”. This topic will contain a concept topic explaining how they can use the “Zotero Connector” tool to add items to their library.<!-- a concept topic would normally explain what something, but not how to DO something. I agree with your rationale here, but just not with the assumption of writing how to do something -->

The concept topic will provide a general introduction and overview of the subtopic, in which it explains its features and limitations. Concept topics will also contain references and glossary terms for the user’s convenience. <!-- good idea -->

*Step-by-Step Instructions as Task Topics*

Once the user has learned the basic information in order to complete a task, they can use the step-by-step procedures to help them accomplish it. Task topics will follow concepts topics, which provide users with a detailed list of how to complete the task they aimed to accomplish.

*Content Reuse*

We will write topics that allow for reuse by following a consistent syntactical structure, using a consistent vocabulary, and abiding by the Hierarchy of Task Topic Elements. This consistent structure will prove useful to the user because there are concepts, tasks, references, and glossary terms that are relevant to multiple different topics, and a familiarity with them already will allow them to focus entirely on the new information. <!-- Good. Do you already have a sense of where these re-used content blocks will go? -->

**Project Planning Phases**

Our group has created an outline and set of guidelines of what to include in our project as appropriate for our intended audience. Our documents are structured to allow changes to focus on proper DITA structure and any additional content or redaction that is necessary moving forward.

*Research*

Our group will use multiple resources to ensure we understand and use the best DITA practices. Resources include articles and books from: Bellamy, Carey, and Schlotfeldt for DITA best practices, Evia for creating content with DITA, Carey for creating content that is concise, cohesive and clear (clarity), Baker in conjunction with Hackos & IBM for creating standalone topics, and Ament for building content that is reusable.

*Topic Development*

An outline with color coded sections of overarching topics followed by concepts, tasks, references and glossary terms has been produced. Our group will use this outline moving forward in the project, with room for changes in the order of sections depending on any reworkings necessary for proper project flow and DITA structuring. We will use Oxygen XML software and Atom to create our DITA documentation as presented from our project outline.

*Media Development*

Our group will use edited screen captures, videos and gifs to help users visualize complex functions of the Zotero software. We will use print screen, gyazo, OBS studios and other appropriate software to capture video, sound recordings <!-- sound recordings! That's intriguing -->, gifs and screenshots when necessary. We will review, revise and edit the captured content to ensure clear visual and audio quality for users.

*Further Revision and Editing*

Zotero documentation will be created with a graduate student read to learn to do audience in mind. Editing and revision phases will reflect changes necessary for easy reuse of the material. Editing and revision will also reflect changes for cohesion, clarity, concision, and proper DITA documentation guidelines as presented from our research.
