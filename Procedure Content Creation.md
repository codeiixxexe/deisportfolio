## Using Zotero

 Use Zotero to store documents, document notes, important files, links and more for your research and readings.

These guidelines assume you have already downloaded the zotero desktop app for PC.
If you have not downloaded the zotero desktop app, you can do so at this [google chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/?brand=CHBD&gclid=Cj0KCQjwtsv7BRCmARIsANu-CQfI4leFTuJEFmSw0VjOvK37ijcMy2kLyUiuJgB8ScsvX7p6YB-sjSwaAkEhEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) link.

Create a Zotero web account after installing the desktop app.
Connect the account to the desktop app to backup files.

Create an account [here](https://www.google.com).

## Using Collections

Use collections (groups of items) in Zotero to organize documents and notes in a hierarchical or folder structure. Collections group similar items together for projects, course work, similar topics and more. You can import items into collections after you place them in your library or add the items from your computer into the collection.

You can place items in multiple collections and sub-collections without duplicating the item.

## Create a Collection

1. Open the Zotero desktop app.

  This example includes screenshots of **My Library** filled with documents.

3. Place your cursor over the collection button.

5. Type in a title for the collection.
6. Click **ok**.

  For this example we have chosen the title "Dogs"

## Create a subcollection

  Use subcollections to organize collections of items into sub categories. Creating a subcollection to group together items helps you keep track of the parent item they belong too. Create a subcollection via two methods.

Method 1

1. Right click your collection.
2. Left click new subcollection in the drop down menu.
3. Create a title for the new subcollection.
4. Click **ok**.

## Add Items to a Collection

Before you begin

 Add items to a collection by uploading a document from your computer, linking to an item on the internet, or moving an item in your library into the collection. Adding items from your library's website, Google Scholar, JSTOR etc., can help you keep track of many documents for school assignments and projects.

## Add Items from Links

1. Pull up your item on a google chrome page.
2. Copy the URL.
3. In the Zotero app, click the new item button. ![new item button](https://i.imgur.com/ezJukHu.png)

  If you do not see this column, place your cursor on the far right edge of the screen. Left click and hold the white arrow that appears. Hold left click and drag your mouse left. The column will appear.

## Writing Notes

Creating notes can help you keep track of your thoughts and discoveries during your research process. You can attach notes to items or create standalone notes. Standalone notes are notes that are not connected to any item in your Zotero library.

Add child notes to items to create a direct connection with research notes and files.

Add standalone notes as their own items for general references and thoughts.

## Add Standalone Notes

1. Left click the "new note" button at the top left.
2. Left click "new standalone note"
3. Double left click the new note item.
4. Begin writing your notes.


  You cannot create a child note from any note type.
  Notes do not have titles. The first line of your note will act as a "title" preview for reference.

Figure 4.1

  Optional: Create a title preview heading for your notes using the "paragraph" tool. This example uses "Heading 1" from the paragraph tool.

  Standalone notes will be added to collections if you are in the collection when you create the note.
