<!-- Good work on the justification for this DITA plan. I also like how you are breaking down all of the potentially relevant topics to cover. Have a look through my notes above and then let's talk about how you have some of these topics categorized and described. We should also talk about whether there are some topics in this outline that are more niche than you need to worry about for this project. Grade: 90/100 -->
